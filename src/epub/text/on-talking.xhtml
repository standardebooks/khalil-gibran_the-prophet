			<p>And then a scholar said, Speak of Talking.</p>
			<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
			<p>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;</p>
			<p>And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.</p>
			<p>And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.</p>
			<p>For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.</p>
			<p>The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape.</p>
			<p>And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.</p>
			<p>And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.</p>
			<p>In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.</p>
			<p>Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;</p>
			<p>For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered</p>
			<p>When the colour is forgotten and the vessel is no more.</p>
