			<p>And a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain.</p>
			<p>And he said:</p>
			<p>Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.</p>
			<p>Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.</p>
			<p>And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;</p>
			<p>And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.</p>
			<p>And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Much of your pain is self-chosen.</p>
			<p>It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.</p>
			<p>Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:</p>
			<p>For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,</p>
			<p>And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.</p>
