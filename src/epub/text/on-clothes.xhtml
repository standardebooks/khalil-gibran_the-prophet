			<p>And the weaver said, Speak to us of Clothes.</p>
			<p>And he answered:</p>
			<p>Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.</p>
			<p>And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.</p>
			<p>Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,</p>
			<p>For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Some of you say, “It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear.”</p>
			<p>And I say, Ay, it was the north wind,</p>
			<p>But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.</p>
			<p>And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.</p>
			<p>Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.</p>
			<p>And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?</p>
			<p>And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.</p>
