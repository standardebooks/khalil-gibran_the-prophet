			<p>And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.</p>
			<p>And he said:</p>
			<p>Your children are not your children.</p>
			<p>They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.</p>
			<p>They come through you but not from you,</p>
			<p>And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>You may give them your love but not your thoughts,</p>
			<p>For they have their own thoughts.</p>
			<p>You may house their bodies but not their souls,</p>
			<p>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</p>
			<p>You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.</p>
			<p>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p>
			<p>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p>
			<p>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</p>
			<p>Let your bending in the Archer’s hand be for gladness;</p>
			<p>For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p>
