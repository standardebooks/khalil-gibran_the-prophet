			<p>And a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge.</p>
			<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
			<p>Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.</p>
			<p>But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.</p>
			<p>You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.</p>
			<p>You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>And it is well you should.</p>
			<p>The hidden wellspring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;</p>
			<p>And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.</p>
			<p>But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;</p>
			<p>And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.</p>
			<p>For self is a sea boundless and measureless.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.”</p>
			<p>Say not, “I have found the path of the soul.” Say rather, “I have met the soul walking upon my path.”</p>
			<p>For the soul walks upon all paths.</p>
			<p>The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.</p>
			<p>The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.</p>
